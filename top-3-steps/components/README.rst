We don't need to put our components in a special directory;
the directory can be named anything. The only special directories are `/pages` and `/public`.
You can even create the Component inside the `pages` directory.

## Using components

Two cases for shared components:

1. As common header components
2. As Layouts.

you can also use components for styling, page layouts, and any other tasks you like.
Additionally, you can import components from NPM modules and use them.
